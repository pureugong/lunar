## Project Overview

**Lunar** is a Korean lunar calendar ICS file generator. It converts lunar (음력) dates to solar (양력/Gregorian) dates and generates downloadable `.ics` calendar files covering all matching dates up to 2050. The app is hosted as a static GitHub Pages site at `pureugong.github.io/lunar/`.

- **Version**: 2.0.0
- **Author**: Yunho, Jo (pureugong)
- **License**: UNLICENSED

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Vue.js 3.x (single-file components, `.vue` files)
- **Bundler**: Vite 6
- **UI**: Bootstrap 4 (loaded via CDN in `index.html`)
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6), Korean UI text throughout

### Key Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `vue` | Frontend framework |
| `holiday-kr` | Lunar-to-solar date conversion for Korean calendar |
| `ics` | Generates ICS (iCalendar) format event files |
| `@faker-js/faker` | Random filename generation for downloaded `.ics` files |

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production build (outputs to dist/)
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

- `npm run dev` → `vite`
- `npm run build` → `vite build`
- `npm run preview` → `vite preview`

There are no test scripts or linter configurations. CI/CD is handled by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) which builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `master`.

## Architecture & Data Flow

1. `index.html` loads Bootstrap from CDN; Vite injects the built JS/CSS assets
2. `src/main.js` creates a Vue 3 app via `createApp()` and mounts it to `#app`
3. `App.vue` renders a header card with the version (read from `package.json`) and the `<event-form>` component
4. `EventForm.vue` contains all business logic:
   - User enters a lunar event name and selects a date
   - `holiday-kr.getSolar()` converts the lunar date to solar for each year up to 2050
   - Both regular and leap month (윤달) dates are handled
   - The `ics` library generates ICS content as a data URI
   - `@faker-js/faker` generates a random whimsical filename for the download

## Code Conventions

- **Language**: Korean is used for all user-facing strings (placeholder text, labels, badge text). Code variables and comments are in English.
- **Component style**: Vue 3 options API with `data` as a function, `computed` properties, `watch`, and `methods`.
- **Date handling**: Dates are stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, split and joined manually. The `padder()` utility zero-pads numbers to 2 digits.
- **No TypeScript**: Pure JavaScript throughout.
- **No linting/formatting tools**: No ESLint, Prettier, or editorconfig is configured.
- **CI-generated build artifacts**: `dist/` is gitignored and built fresh by GitHub Actions on each push to `master`. Do not commit build output manually.

## Deployment Notes

- GitHub Pages **must** use `build_type: "workflow"` (not `"legacy"`) for the `actions/deploy-pages` CI workflow to work. Legacy mode serves raw repo files from the root, ignoring the built `dist/` output — causing the site to 404 on `/src/main.js`.
- Fix command if it ever reverts: `gh api repos/pureugong/lunar/pages -X PUT -f build_type=workflow`
- The deploy workflow only triggers on push to `master` (no `workflow_dispatch`). To re-trigger without a new commit: `gh run rerun <run-id>`.

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

- The `dist/` directory is gitignored and generated by `npm run build`. Do not edit it directly. Edit source files in `src/` and let CI rebuild.
- The `table.js` file contains a hardcoded lunar calendar lookup table spanning 1901–2050. Each row is an array of 12 values representing month lengths. Values of 3–6 indicate leap months.
- The app only supports dates from 1900 to 2050 due to the lunar table data range.
- Bootstrap 4 is loaded from CDN in `index.html`, not installed via npm. Vue components use Bootstrap CSS classes directly.
- There are no tests. When modifying logic, manually verify by running `npm run dev` and testing in the browser.
- Commit messages in this repo are informal and short. Follow the existing style.
